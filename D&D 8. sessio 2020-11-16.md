[[Mortlock Vanthampur]] tunnusti lähettäneensä salamurhaajat murhaamaan [[Duke Portyr]]. Selvisi että [[Cult of Zariel]] käyttää [[Cult of the Dead Three]]tä hyväkseen. Sovittiin listivämme viereisestä huoneesta [[Vaaz]] yhdessä.

Tapettiin [[Vaaz]]. Taistelun yhteydessä [[Mortlock Vanthampur]] meni kanveesiin, häntä hoitaessaan [[Alrik]] löysi seuraavat viestit:

My dearest Mortlock,

The temple is located beneath the Frolicking Nymph. In the north massage room, rotate the circular element in the stained glass window and the door will open. Vaaz, Flennis, and Yignath, along with their minions, should already be ensconced.

Flennis will be relatively easy to manage, but you may have some difficulty with the other two. Yignath is too ambitious. The trick will be keeping him reined in, otherwise he could easily compromise the bloodletting with some other foolhardy endeavor. Vaaz, on the other hand, is simply bull-headed. He’ll strain against the leash unless you pull it. So pull it hard.

You should not return to the manor until the work is done.

Mortlock,

I warned you to keep a leash on Yignath! What’s done is done, but I hope this will be the last bit of foolishness you’ll allow to happen.

The kidnapping of Satiir Thione-Hhune is particularly vexing, but perhaps we can turn it to our advantage as long as she’s not harmed. (Or, at least, not harmed until it’s useful for us to do so.) Take custody of her and transfer her to the manor as quickly as possible.

Thurstwell is also intrigued by the mask they found. Send it along with Satiir so that he can study it.

Mortlock,

That fool Portyr has emerged from his mansion. He’ll be giving a simpering speech in support of his misguided Confraternity of Refugee Relief at the Beloved Ranger. This is the opportunity we’ve been waiting for. If we kill him now, it should disrupt his brat Liara’s attempts to steal the Flaming Fist from us.

I’m enclosing a packet of information for Vaaz, along with a very special weapon which has been prepared just for Portyr. Act quickly, my son!

Lähdettiin ylös kylpylästä, törmättiin Dragon Cultisteihin, selvittiin juttelemalla. Suunnattiin kohti [[Beloved Ranger]]ia.  Ensimmäinen vartija ei oikein ollut yhteistyökykyinen. [[Duke Portyr]] saapuu paikalle. [[Vanthampur Manor]]issa on tiamatin aarteen maski.
