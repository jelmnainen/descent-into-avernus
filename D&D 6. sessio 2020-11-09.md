Löydettiin [[Vendetta Kross]], jota oli kidutettu. Kavahti zombi-[[Faris Muno | Farista]]. Lähdettiin metsästämään kiduttajaa.

Löydettiin jengi kultisteja ja niiltä seuraavat viestit:

[[Vaaz]]— My brother [[Thrustwell Vanthampur | Thrustwell]] and I are agreed. [[Mortlock Vanthampur | Mortlock]] is not only a liability to us, but a liability to you, taking credit for all of the good work that you and your Fists are doing for us. Rid us of our troublesome brother and send his right ring finger to me at the [[Low Lanter]] as proof and I will see to it that you are raised about [[Flennis]] and [[Yigtnath]] in this affair. You will be the liaison between the Shield of the Hidden Lord and your fellow cultists. It will be your face that [[Gargauth]] sees. He will know that YOU are the one responsible for carrying out his will! [[Bane]] himself will know your name when [[Gargauth]] sings your praises unto him!

Act swift, with the strength of the fist and the finality of the knife, my friend!
														[[Amrik Vanthampur | Amrik]]  of the House Vanthampur

[[Flennis]],

Know ye that these missives pass through holy hands directly from the [[Shield of the Hidden Lord]], which speaks with the True Voice of [[Gargauth]], Once Lord of Avernus and Treasurer of Hell, the Tenth Lord of the Nine, the Hidden Lord, the Lord Who Watches, and Legatus of the Dark Gods.

When the devils of Avernus brought down [[Elturel]], the [[Duke Ravenguard | Grand Duke of Baldur’s Gate]] was claimed as a prize for Hell. So too shall you claim for [[Zariel]] the souls of those who once served Elturel. You can know this to be truth, for I hold here, at Vanthampur Manor, secure within its infernal puzzlebox, the pact with [[Zariel]]; the declaration of the powerful purpose to which we set our hands. Lay to rest your doubts.

[[Vaaz]],

Know ye that these missives are inscribed by my hand at [[Vanthampur Manor]], passing through holy hands directly from the [[Shield of the Hidden Lord]], which speaks with the True Voice of [[Gargauth]], Once Lord of Avernus and Treasurer of Hell, the Outcast, and Legatus of the Dark Gods.

Seek ye the blood of the holy orders of Elturgard. That is the commandment of this hour. Let he great work which was begun in the light of the Companion be completed here under the aegis of the Dark Gods.

[[Duke Thalamra Vanthampur | Vanthampur]] shall remain within her manor for this time, for she has mighty work to do and must consult constantly with us in its pursuit. But just as she has given unto you the temple of your forefathers, so you shall obey the fruit of her loins. Her three sons speak with my voice and work to our common cause.

-[[T.K.]].

[[Vaaz]],

[[Duke Portyr]] will be delivering a speech at the [[Beloved Ranger]] in the Wide during an event held by the [[Confraternity of Refugee Relief]]. Give the iron barb I have enclosed in this packet to your best assassin.

I know that you will serve me well in this.
